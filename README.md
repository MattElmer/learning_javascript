#### What is this?

__Short Answer:__  Learn javascript by proving concepts with tests. :)

__Longer Answer:__ This is a compilation of Javascript "code snippets" as I work through resources to master Javascript. Each resource (book/guide/tutorial/etc) has it's own folder with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) tests proving how the concepts apply in a semi real world context.

#### How to install and use

##### Option 1 - Run tests in browswer
Download the project ([click here](https://github.com/denvercodeclub/learning_javascript/archive/master.zip)). Open the zip file, and find the  `learning_javascript/resources/professional_javascript-zakas/SpecRunner.html`  file, and double click on it. This runs the tests in your browser. Yay!! You're up and running.  



##### Option 2 - Run tests via NodeJS

1. Install node,  
    - Mac, `brew install nodejs` or [node downloads page](http://nodejs.org/download/)  
    - Linux, `sudo apt-get install node`  
    - Windows, [node downloads page](http://nodejs.org/download/)  

2. Install git,  
    - Mac, `brew install git` or [git downloads page](http://git-scm.com/downloads)  
    - Linux, `sudo apt-get install git`  
    - Windows, [git downloads page](http://git-scm.com/downloads)  

3. Shell Commands

```sh
git clone https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript.git
cd learning_javascript
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
npm test
```

#### Contributions

I'd love your help! ([Open a Github issue](https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript/issues/new)) - the pros, cons, and everything in between. 

I'll make adjustments to make the project more helpful and easier to use as I get input.
