#### What is this?

__Short Answer:__  Learn javascript by proving concepts with tests. :)

__Longer Answer:__ This is a compilation of Javascript "code snippets" as I work through resources to master Javascript. Each resource (book/guide/tutorial/etc) has it's own folder with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) tests proving how the concepts apply in a semi real world context.

#### How to install and use

To get started quick without setting up NodeJS, go to [https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript](https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript), and download the project. There's a button the right side titled, "Download ZIP". Once downloaded to your computer, open the zip file, and find the  `learning_javascript/resources/professional_javascript-zakas/SpecRunner.html`  file, and double click on it. This runs the tests in your browser.

If you want to run tests using NodeJS ...

Install node,  
- Mac, `brew install nodejs`  
- Mac alternative, go to [node mac installer](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.21/node-v0.10.21.pkg) and download file.  Double-click to install.
- Linux `sudo apt-get install node`  
- Windows go to [node downloads page](http://nodejs.org/download/)  

and it's super simple,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript.git
cd learning_javascript
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
npm test
```

#### Current resources:  
- [Professional Javascript for Web Developers by Nicholas Zakas](https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript/tree/master/professional_javascript-zakas)

#### Planned resources:  
- Javascript Patterns
- (open to ideas)

#### Contributions

I'd love your help! ([Open a Github issue](https://github.com/westonplatter/learning_javascript/issues/new)) - the pros, cons, and everything in between. 

I'll make adjustments to make the project more helpful and easier to use as I get input.
